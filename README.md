# Hyperparameter-Optimization

Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is used in machine learning to find the best settings (hyperparameters) for a learning algorithm to maximize model performance, accuracy, and generalization on a specific dataset.

In this case it was applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset and another synthetic dataset.
